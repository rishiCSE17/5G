# 1. 5G Intro
## 1.1. 5GPPP & NGMN 
* 5GPPP : 5G public private partnership project 
    > * Joint colab between European Communication & European ICT Industry 
    > * ICT industry includes : ICT Manufacturers, Telcom operators, ISP, SME & Research Institute 
    > * 21 project lauched in June2017 at Brussel 
    > * 1000 times higher wireless area coverage 
    > * saves 90% energy/SP 
    > * Service creation time from 90 Hrs to 90 mins 
    > * Denser deployment
* NGMN : Next Gen Mobile Network 
    > * industry organization of world wide telco operators, vendors, R&D 
    > * Founded by INO at 2006
    > 
### Demands 
* High level E2E architecture (Software & Hardware)
    * netive support of SDN & NFV 
    * Network slicing : SGi Interface (4G), Service Driven slicing (uRLLC, mMTC, eMBB, IoT)
    
## Design Objective 
* Solution to Current crowded spectrum . 
    * 5G demand high frequency, ultra dense network.
    * Use of large portion of free spectrum bands (BW & Prpagation condition)
    * Spectrum sharing techniques are introduced (SDN & NFV for monitoring)
    * Highly efficient transmission and data processing techniques (Function must be introduced under Radio
    protocol stack)
    * Placing network function closer to the user (MEC)
    * Seperate User and control plane (SDN), redefine the network boundary (Core & edge)
    * change in architecture introduces new overhead such as interfaces, services etc. (challenge)
    * Multi-Connectivity K
